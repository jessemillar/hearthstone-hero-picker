#Hearthstone Hero Picker

Using the Deck Helper feature of Hearthstone is the closest one can get to simulating Hearthstone Arena play against friends without owning all possible cards or buying enough packs to build a "randomly generated" deck. Use the [Hearthstone Hero Picker](http://www.jessemillar.com/hearthstone-hero-picker/) to have three heroes randomly presented to you. Pick a hero, create a new deck, and then use the Deck Helper to build a semi-random deck to play with against people in your friends list.
